🎯 Objective
Learn how to assign predefined categories to text using different classification strategies, models, and best practices.

📌 What is Text Classification?
Assigning one or more labels to text.

Tasks include spam detection, sentiment analysis, language ID, etc.

Most common and widely deployed NLP application in industry.

🧩 Types of Classification
Type	Description
Binary	2 classes (e.g., spam vs not-spam)
Multiclass	One of many classes (e.g., movie review: positive, neutral, negative)
Multilabel	Multiple labels for same input (e.g., news: “sports”, “politics”)
Extreme	Hundreds/thousands of classes (e.g., product catalogs)
Hierarchical	Labels organized in tree structure (e.g., taxonomy classification) 

📚 Popular Applications
Content Organization: E.g., auto-tagging, folder classification, recommendations.

Customer Support: Flag actionable tweets, classify support requests.

E-commerce: Sentiment and aspect-based review analysis.

Fake News Detection, Authorship Attribution, Mental Health Triage

⚙️ Text Classification Pipeline
Data Collection (labeled)

Train/Validation/Test Split

Text Vectorization (TF-IDF, embeddings)

Model Training

Evaluation

Deployment & Monitoring

Steps 3–5 are often iterative.

🛠️ Algorithms
🔹 Traditional ML:
Naive Bayes: Fast, interpretable. Assumes feature independence.

SVM: Handles high-dim sparse data well. Works for linear/non-linear cases.

Decision Trees, Logistic Regression: Used with engineered features.

🔹 Deep Learning:
CNNs: Capture local patterns in text (like n-grams).

RNNs/LSTMs: Capture long-range dependencies and order in text.

BERT & Transformers: Pretrained models fine-tuned for classification tasks
.

📏 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Confusion matrix: To understand misclassifications.

Business KPIs: Like reduction in wait times, ROI uplift
.

🧪 Handling Data Challenges
Imbalanced Data
Resampling, weighted loss functions, or more data collection.

Low-Data Scenarios
Weak supervision: Use heuristic rules to label data.

Active learning: Label only the most uncertain samples.

Transfer learning: Fine-tune large pretrained models.

Noisy Labels
Use robust algorithms, aggregate multiple noisy labels.

🧠 Practical Tips
Start simple: Strong baselines before jumping to deep models.

Human-in-the-loop: Use manual review for uncertain cases.

Model is only 10% of the system: focus on data, pipeline, deployment.

Ensemble methods: Combine classifiers for better results

.

📍 Final Takeaways
Text classification is the backbone of most industrial NLP.

Use appropriate model for use case: don’t overcomplicate.

Feature engineering and evaluation strategy are as crucial as modeling.

🎯 Objective
Showcase how NLP can impact large, regulation-heavy domains like healthcare, finance, and law—each rich in unstructured text and domain-specific challenges.

🏥 Healthcare
📌 Key Applications
Health Record Analysis: Extract insights from Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

Outcome Prediction: Predict readmission, mortality using RNNs on EHR data.

Mental Health Monitoring: Analyze language patterns from text (e.g., Reddit posts) for early signs of depression or suicide risk.

Pharmacovigilance: Monitor drug side-effects from social media and records.

Clinical Decision Support: Assist doctors in treatment, diagnosis using NLP pipelines.

🧪 Tools & Techniques
HARVEST: Visualizes patient history using NLP-based summarization.

HealthTermFinder: Extracts and normalizes medical terms using UMLS.

BioBERT: Fine-tuned BERT for biomedical text—used for QA, NER, relation extraction.

Comprehend Medical: AWS service to extract diagnoses, dosage, etc., from EHRs.

💰 Finance
📌 Key Applications
Sentiment Analysis: Specialized sentiment (e.g., "positive" means stock goes up).

Tool: FinBERT—fine-tuned on Reuters + Financial PhraseBank.

Loan Risk Assessment:

Extract structured data from documents using NER.

Analyze tone, coherence in borrower responses.

Auditing & Accounting:

Automate detection of anomalies in financial statements.

Detect fraud or operational risks from patterns in transactional documents.

🧠 Use Cases
NLP helps financial firms (e.g., Deloitte, EY) enhance audit reports, identify fraud, and reduce compliance costs.

Capital Float uses NLP to assess entrepreneurial ability in loan applicants.

⚖️ Legal
📌 Key Applications
Contract Review & Generation:

Tools: SpotDraft, ROSS Intelligence (for legal research).

Extract clauses, obligations, and timelines.

Legal Discovery:

Analyze large sets of case files for relevant arguments or anomalies.

Tools: Siren.io, LexNLP, ContraxSuite.

Entity Extraction:

Extract acts, definitions, constraints, legal durations using LexNLP.

✅ Final Takeaways
Regulatory industries are rich in unstructured, sensitive, and often complex text.

NLP improves accuracy, speed, compliance, and decision-making.

Tools like BioBERT, FinBERT, and LexNLP provide domain-specific advantages.

Consider interpretability and risk when deploying models in life-impacting industries.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Quickly introduce key NLP applications beyond core tasks: search, topic modeling, summarization, recommendation, translation, and QA systems.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Search & Information Retrieval
NLP improves query understanding, ranking, snippet generation, and entity extraction.

Components: Indexing (e.g., using TF-IDF), document ranking, spell correction, related queries.

DL models like BERT improve snippet relevance and search quality.

Enterprise search pipelines include custom document processing, indexing, and ranking.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Topic Modeling
Unsupervised learning to discover topics from large text corpora.

Most common technique: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Outputs: documents as mixtures of topics, topics as distributions of words.

Example: Documents about food/pets can be clustered using word distributions.

Use cases: summarization, trend detection, document classification.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Text Summarization
Types:
Extractive: Select important sentences.

Abstractive: Generate new sentences (more complex).

Query-focused vs query-independent.

Single-document vs multi-document summarization.

Tools & Examples:
Sumy, Gensim (TextRank)

Reddit autotldr bot, news highlighters, summarization for indexing.

Challenges:
Sensitive to text size and preprocessing (e.g., sentence segmentation).

Abstractive methods are still research-heavy and require DL or RL.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Recommender Systems for Text
Content-based (e.g., related articles) vs collaborative filtering (e.g., Netflix).

Use topic models or embeddings (e.g., Doc2Vec) to recommend related texts.

Example: Recommend books using text similarity on summaries.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Machine Translation
APIs like Google Translate, Azure Translator.

Use neural models (seq2seq, attention) for better fluency and contextual accuracy.

Custom training is expensive and best left to companies with specific needs.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Question-Answering (QA)
Two types:

Extractive QA (return spans from documents).

Knowledge-based QA (map queries to knowledge bases).

Tools: SQuAD, CDQA-Suite, AllenNLP, Bing Answer Search API.

High cost for building web-scale QA systems.

ðŸ§ª Evaluation & Practical Tips
Summarization: use ROUGE scores, or custom human evaluations.

Text length affects performance: use smart slicing or partitioning.

Topic model tuning: choose number of topics manually; use coherence for quality check.

âœ… Final Takeaways
These tasks may not be core NLP applications but are highly impactful in production.

Each task builds on prior concepts: embeddings, classification, extraction, etc.

Start with off-the-shelf tools, and customize as needed.

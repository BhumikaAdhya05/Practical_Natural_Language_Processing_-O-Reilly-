🎯 Objective
Extract structured information (entities, relationships, events) from unstructured text using various NLP techniques and tools.

🗂️ What Is Information Extraction (IE)?
IE is the task of converting unstructured text into structured data (e.g., entities, dates, relationships).

Examples: Google blurbs, calendar event extraction, news tagging.

📌 IE vs Text Classification
Feature	Text Classification	Information Extraction
Input Format	Labeled Texts	Raw Unstructured Text
Output	Class Label	Structured Records
Complexity	Lower	Higher (requires deep NLP)
Techniques	Standard ML/DL	POS, NER, Parsing, Linking

🧭 Applications of IE
News Tagging: Extract people, orgs, places (e.g., Google News).

Chatbots: Pull entities and context to respond accurately.

Receipts/Forms: Extract amounts, dates (used in banking/fintech apps).

Social Media Monitoring: Extract disaster reports, traffic info, etc.

⚙️ Key IE Tasks
Task	Description
Keyphrase Extraction	Extract key concepts (e.g., “buyback,” “stock price”).
Named Entity Recognition (NER)	Identify proper nouns (e.g., “Apple,” “Luca Maestri”).
Entity Linking	Link to real-world entries (e.g., “Apple” = Apple Inc.).
Relation Extraction	Discover connections (e.g., “Luca is CFO of Apple”).
Event Extraction	Detect structured events (e.g., “Apple buys back stocks”).
Temporal IE	Extract normalized time expressions (e.g., “Friday” → 2025-06-13).
Template Filling	Fill predefined slots in event templates (e.g., meeting date, place, time).

🛠️ IE Pipeline
More NLP-intensive than classification.

Typical steps include:

Text Cleaning

POS Tagging

NER

Dependency Parsing

Coreference Resolution

Task-specific modeling

🧪 Techniques Used
Rule-Based: Regex for dates, contact details, boilerplate removal.

Statistical Models: CRFs, HMMs for sequence labeling tasks (e.g., NER).

Deep Learning: LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers for contextual extraction.

Libraries/Tools: spaCy, textacy, Duckling (for temporal IE), Google Cloud NLP, AWS Comprehend.

📊 Real-World Case Study: Meeting Info from Email
Goal: Extract meeting details (time, location, invitees).

Approach:

Rule-based start → CRF model → LSTM with BERT features.

Feedback loop and fine-tuning using user interaction logs.

Handle multiple meeting mentions via multilabel classification.

💡 Practical Tips
Pretrained Models are often sufficient unless domain is highly specific.

Hybrid Approach (rules + ML) is common in production.

Start Simple, expand gradually based on feedback and accuracy needs.

Text Extraction Quality (from PDFs, HTML, etc.) heavily impacts performance.

🧭 Summary of Challenges
IE requires:

Rich domain-specific data.

Careful preprocessing.

Balancing precision & recall.

Often better to use external APIs unless building for niche domain.

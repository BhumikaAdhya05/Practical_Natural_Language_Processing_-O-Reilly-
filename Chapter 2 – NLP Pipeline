🧠 Chapter 2 – NLP Pipeline
🎯 Objective
Explain the structure, steps, and best practices of a typical real-world NLP pipeline.

🏗️ Overview of NLP Pipeline
A pipeline is a sequence of stages for building and maintaining an NLP model. The core stages are:

Data Acquisition

Text Cleaning

Text Preprocessing

Feature Engineering (Text Representation)

Modeling

Evaluation

Deployment

Monitoring and Model Updating

🔹 Step-by-Step Summary
1. Data Acquisition
Collect data relevant to the problem domain.

Sources: internal logs, scraped web data, public datasets.

Start with heuristics if data is small, use ML/DL when data is large.

In low-data scenarios, use transfer learning, weak supervision, or data augmentation.

2. Text Cleaning
Remove HTML, boilerplate, extra spaces, special characters, etc.

Tools: regex, BeautifulSoup (for HTML cleanup).

3. Preprocessing
Core tasks:

Sentence segmentation, tokenization.

Stopword removal, lowercasing.

Stemming or lemmatization.

Advanced tasks:

POS tagging, parsing, coreference resolution.

Normalization (e.g., social media normalization), language detection.

4. Feature Engineering / Text Representation
Convert text to numerical form (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).

Classical ML: handcrafted features (e.g., counts, presence of keywords).

DL: automatic representation learning (word2vec, BERT embeddings).

5. Modeling
Choose model based on task and data:

Traditional ML: SVM, Naive Bayes.

DL: CNN, RNN, Transformers.

Consider constraints: latency, interpretability, scalability.

6. Evaluation
Model metrics: accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, AUC.

Business metrics: revenue impact, task automation rate.

Use both intrinsic (model) and extrinsic (business) evaluations.

7. Deployment
Integrate model into the larger software system.

Steps:

Package model (e.g., as .pkl or ONNX).

Serve model (e.g., REST API, batch process).

Ensure scalability (cloud or on-prem scaling).

8. Monitoring and Model Updating
Track model health using performance dashboards.

Automate retraining using new feedback/data.

Decide update frequency: daily, weekly, monthly.

Use online learning or memoization strategies when latency is a concern.

🔍 Special Considerations
Language support: tailor pipeline for low-resource languages or morphologically rich languages.

Deployment strategy: consider use case—real-time systems (chatbots) vs batch systems (reporting).

Pipeline flexibility: real-world pipelines loop between evaluation, preprocessing, and modeling often.

🧪 Case Study: Uber COTA (Customer Support)
Goal: classify and route support tickets.

Pipeline: Data → Cleaning → Preprocessing (lemmatization, tokenization) → TF-IDF/LSI → Similarity scoring → Binary classification + ranking → Evaluation → Deployment → Monitoring.

Impact: Improved efficiency, reduced cost, and faster resolution.

📌 Final Takeaways
Not all steps are needed for every project.

NLP pipelines are iterative, not strictly linear.

Build strong baselines early and optimize later.

Align feature design and evaluation with business goals.

🎯 Objective
Apply NLP to solve core problems in e-commerce: product search, reviews, recommendations, and cataloging.

🛒 Key Use Cases in E-Commerce NLP
Task	NLP Contribution
Product Search	Understand user queries, map to catalog attributes (e.g., color, brand)
Review Analysis	Sentiment analysis, summarization, helpfulness scoring
Product Recommendations	Use behavior, reviews, and text content to recommend related items
Catalog Management	Extract and normalize product attributes, deduplicate, enrich product metadata
Product Categorization	Classify items into hierarchical taxonomies using titles, descriptions

🔍 1. Product Search & Faceted Navigation
Faceted search: Enables navigation by filters (e.g., price, size, brand).

Needs attribute extraction for filterable properties.

Use NLP to identify and correct missing or noisy metadata.

Tools: Elasticsearch, Solr for search + facets.

🧾 2. Building a Product Catalog
a. Attribute Extraction
Extract structured fields (e.g., color, gender, size) from product titles/descriptions.

ML/DL models used: CRFs, HMMs, LSTMs.

b. Product Categorization
Classify into taxonomies (e.g., Electronics > Computers > Laptops).

Hierarchical classification using rule-based + ML methods.

c. Product Enrichment
Improve titles using template-based systems.

Remove irrelevant terms (e.g., "iPhone" from stylus title).

Helps boost click-through and conversion rates.

d. Deduplication & Matching
Detect and merge listings for the same product with different descriptions.

Use NLP + image analysis (e.g., Siamese networks) for matching.

🧠 3. Review Analysis
Task	Description
Sentiment Analysis	Polarity of review (positive/negative/neutral)
Aspect Sentiment	Sentiment for specific features (e.g., screen, battery)
Summarization	Use LexRank to summarize grouped aspect reviews
Helpfulness Ranking	Highlight expert or popular reviews

Combine editorial + user reviews for balanced insights.

🎯 4. Product Recommendations
Types:
Behavior-based: Past clicks, purchases.

Content-based: Product descriptions, reviews, attributes.

Hybrid: Combine both using collaborative filtering + NLP.

Case Study: Substitutes and Complements
Use review-derived topic vectors to infer similarity.

Predict product links using vector similarity + classification.

Enables recommending alternatives and bundled items.

🧪 Additional Techniques
A/B Testing to measure model impact on click rates, conversions, engagement.

Use external categorization APIs (e.g., Semantics3, eBay) for bootstrapping taxonomy.

✅ Final Takeaways
E-commerce NLP = structured + unstructured data fusion.

Start with attribute extraction + faceted search, then layer in review analysis and recommendation.

Scale using hybrid systems: rules + ML + DL.
